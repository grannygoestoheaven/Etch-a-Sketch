# Etch-a-Sketch
The concept is to have a fixed-sized grid full of squares that animate when passed over with the mouse.
The mouvement of the mouse is supposed to leave a trail behind it.

There is a button at the top ; it displays a popup window asking the user to enter in a prompt the number of squares per side he wants.
The right number of squares is then generated and fill the grid, thus giving the resolution corresponding to the user's chosen value.

Each time the button is pressed, the grid turns empty and the popup with the prompt command is displayed again.
