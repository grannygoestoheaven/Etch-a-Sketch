# Etch-a-Sketch
The concept is to have a fixed-sized grid full of squares that animate when passed over with the mouse.
There is a button at the top ; it displays a popup window asking the user to enter the number of square per side he wants in a prompt.
The right number of square is then generated and fill the grid with the resolution corresponding to the user's chosen value.
Each time the button is pressed, the grid turns empty and the popup with the prompt command is displayed again and so on.
